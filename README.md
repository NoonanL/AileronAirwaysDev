# AileronAirwaysDev
Development repository for Team8 IP3 Project "AileronAirways"

This web-application will facilitate the creation of Event Timelines for use by AileronAirways staff. The app will allow users to create and manage Timelines,
capture Event data and link that Event data to relevant timelines.

Getting Started:

-Developer Environment
	Requirements: IntelliJ IDE, Tomcat8. 
	Once you have installed Tomcat8, clone a copy of DevBranch from the repository to a file location of your choosing. DO NOT mess about with the Master 
	branch - this is the release branch. You are then free to develop as you see fit and push commits to DevBranch and then issue Pull requests.
	It will likely be the case that we'll migrate to Maven once we know more about it to handle dependencies.
	
	REMEMBER: Test First!!!
