# AileronAirwaysDev
Development repository for Team8 IP3 Project "AileronAirways"

This web-application will facilitate the creation of Event Timelines for use by AileronAirways staff. The app will allow users to create and manage Timelines,
capture Event data and link that Event data to relevant timelines.

VERSIONING:
This is a major refactor from the original project repository to facilitate the conversion to Maven. These prior versions will be refered to as 0.123 etc.
Current versioning will start at 1.1. Not that this is important or anyone cares. Tryna be professional yo.

Getting Started:

-Developer Environment
	Requirements: IntelliJ IDE
	No need to install Tomcat, all dependencies (with the exception of javascript libraries) are now handled by Maven within pom.xml.
	To run the code simply run the Runner.java class.	
	Clone a copy of AileronAirwaysDev from the repository to a file location of your choosing. DO NOT mess about with the master 
	branch - this is the release branch. Create your own DevBranch. You are then free to develop as you see fit and push commits / issue Pull requests.
	
	REMEMBER: Test First!!!
